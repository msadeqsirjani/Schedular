## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to simulate real-time scheduling in the context of an operating system. Specifically, we aim to create a simulation of a restaurant where a single chef must handle multiple food orders efficiently. The chef's task is to prepare and deliver these orders within specified deadlines. This project provides an opportunity to implement various real-time scheduling algorithms and understand their impact on order delivery in a restaurant setting.
